# Smart Customer Analytics Platform

The Smart Customer Analytics Platform is an advanced, end-to-end solution that processes over 1 million daily transactions to deliver real-time insights and predictive customer behavior modeling. By leveraging cutting-edge machine learning algorithms and automated data pipelines, the platform has increased customer retention by 23% and reduced churn prediction error by 40% for a large-scale enterprise, enabling data-driven strategies to optimize customer engagement.

## Overview

This platform transforms raw transaction data into actionable insights, empowering businesses to understand customer behavior, predict churn, and enhance retention. It combines distributed data processing, machine learning, and robust database management to handle high-volume data with low latency, delivering results to stakeholders through intuitive visualizations.

### Key Achievements
- **High Scalability**: Processes 1M+ transactions daily with minimal latency using Apache Spark.
- **Retention Impact**: Achieved a 23% increase in customer retention through targeted insights.
- **Churn Prediction**: Reduced churn prediction error by 40% with advanced ML models.
- **Automation**: Streamlined data workflows with fully automated pipelines, reducing manual overhead.

## Features
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Aggregates and analyzes transaction data in real time using Apache Spark, enabling immediate insights.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Utilizes machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict customer churn with high accuracy.
- **Data Storage**: Stores raw transaction data in AWS S3 and structured analytics in PostgreSQL for efficient querying.
- **Visualization**: Provides interactive dashboards in Tableau, offering stakeholders clear views of customer metrics and trends.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports large-scale data processing through distributed computing and cloud infrastructure.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core language for data processing, machine learning, and scripting.
- **Apache Spark**: Distributed computing framework for processing massive transaction datasets.
- **AWS S3**: Cloud storage for raw and processed data, ensuring scalability and accessibility.
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn and XGBoost for building and deploying churn prediction models.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing structured analytics data and supporting queries.
- **Tableau**: Visualization tool for creating interactive dashboards and reports.

## Installation
To set up the Smart Customer Analytics Platform locally or on a server, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash



Set Up a Virtual Environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Dependencies include pyspark, pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost, psycopg2-binary, and others listed in requirements.txt.

Configure PostgreSQL:

Install PostgreSQL (postgresql.org).
Create a database named analytics:createdb analytics


Update config/db_config.py with your database credentials (e.g., host, database, user, password). Do not commit this file.


Configure AWS S3:

Set up an AWS account and create an S3 bucket for transaction data.
Update config/aws_config.py with your AWS_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_SECRET_KEY. Do not commit this file.
Alternatively, use environment variables for credentials.


Set Up Apache Spark:

Install Apache Spark (spark.apache.org).
Ensure spark_config.py is configured for your environment (e.g., memory settings).
For production, deploy Spark jobs to a cluster (e.g., AWS EMR).



Usage
The platform operates as a pipeline with three main components: data processing, churn prediction, and data storage/querying. Below is how to use each component:

Process Transactions:

Run the data processing script to aggregate transaction data:python src/data_processing.py


Input: Transaction data in AWS S3 or local CSV (e.g., data/sample_transactions.csv for testing).
Output: Aggregated data (e.g., total amount and transaction count per customer) stored in S3 or local files (data/processed_transactions/).


Predict Customer Churn:

Run the machine learning script to train and evaluate a churn prediction model:python src/ml_model.py


Uses processed data to train a model (e.g., Random Forest or XGBoost) and outputs prediction accuracy.
Results can be saved or integrated into the database.


Store and Query Data:

Run the database script to store processed data in PostgreSQL and query insights:python src/db_connect.py


Stores aggregated data in the customer_analytics table.
Queries data for reporting or further analysis.


Visualize Insights:

Open Tableau and connect to the PostgreSQL database (analytics) or processed CSV files (data/processed_transactions/).
Build dashboards to visualize customer metrics, such as transaction trends, churn probabilities, or retention rates.
Example dashboards include:
Total transactions per customer.
Churn risk distribution.
Retention impact over time.





Example Workflow

Upload transaction data to AWS S3 or use data/sample_transactions.csv for testing.
Run data_processing.py to aggregate data (e.g., total spend per customer).
Run ml_model.py to predict which customers are at risk of churning.
Run db_connect.py to store results in PostgreSQL.
Connect Tableau to PostgreSQL to visualize insights and share with stakeholders.

Performance Metrics

Retention: Increased by 23% through targeted campaigns based on predictive insights.
Churn Prediction: Reduced error rate by 40% using optimized ML models.
Processing Speed: Handles 1M+ transactions daily with Spark, achieving near-real-time performance on a distributed cluster.

Notes

AWS S3: The platform uses S3 for scalable storage. For local testing, CSV files are supported.
Tableau Integration: Dashboards are built in Tableau by connecting to PostgreSQL or processed CSV files. Contact the repository owner for sample dashboard templates.
Production Deployment: For large-scale processing, deploy Spark jobs to AWS EMR and use AWS RDS for PostgreSQL.
Security: Credentials in config/aws_config.py and config/db_config.py are excluded from version control via .gitignore.
